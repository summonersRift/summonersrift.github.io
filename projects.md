<h3>Projects</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Trading Bot</b> (2018) Cryptocurrency trader using financial indicators. The algorithm was successfully deployed on Coinbase/GDAX exchange. The trader used Python-pandas to handle data structures and <i>python-stockstats</i> to calculate the indicators which a trader can mix and match to find the right signals. We used <i>CCXT</i> library to make the API calls, which makes the program independent of the exchange and their API. We also built an early prototype on QuantConnet platform which provides excellent backtesting capability. <b>Tools/Languages:</b> Python; python-stockstats; CCXT; QuantConnect</li>

  <li><b>Arbitrator Bot</b> (2018) A cryptocurrency atbitrator that exploits ask/bid price differences in different market (order depths). For example, if there exists an arbitration <i>BTC/LTC</i> and <i>ETH/LTC</i> markets or the orders, the trader finds the arbitrations for all such coin pairs against the base pairs. Few miliseconds, prototype arbitration processing time achieved for hundreds of markets on cryptocurrency exchange Binance. <b>Languages/Tools</b>: Python; Python-binance API;</li>

  <li><b>Performance Prediction Toolkit (PPT)</b> (2015-2018) 
         Parallel application and system performance prediction toolkit implemented on Simian parallel discrete-event simulator, developed in collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), NM. <b>Languages/Technologies</b>: Python, Simian, <a href="https://github.com/lanl/PPT">github.com/lanl/PPT</a>.</li>

  <li><b>PyPassT</b> (2017-2018). 
         HPC Simulation model construction using static program analysis. A number of advanced program analysis techniques has been used to identify program performance.  <b>Languages/Tools</b> Java, C, CUDA, LLVM, Cetus compiler, Compass, PPT.</li>

  <li><b>SDNScaleNet</b> (2016)
         Network emulation using Linux namespaces, OVS w/ Pox Controller. A cloud infrastucture or data-center network is programmed as a graph or tree in python. Large models can also be built by supplying parameters. Alternatively, the network topology can be read from a file. The network can be deployed as containers with links. Consider connecting Docker / LXC / Linux Namespaces with virtual ip-links/veth-pairs. To enable software defined networking SDNScaleNet uses Open vSwitch(OVS) and pox-controller. <b>Languages/Technologies</b>: Python, Bash(Shell), ip-links, veth-pairs, Linux Network namespaces(ip netns), LXC containers.</li>

  <li><b>Distributed Simulator</b> (2016) 
         Efficient distributed hybrid real-time cloud, data-center, and large network simulator . The real-time simulator PRIME which was  using a simgle core in linux is capable opf processing 300,000 events/second. The simulator makes full use of the event rate of the PRIME real-time simulator. This particular implementation .  C++; PRIME;SSDNScaleNet.</li>

  <li><b>PrimoGENI Constellation</b> (2013 – 2015) Developed distributed hybrid network experimentation on NSF GENI testbed. <b>Languages/Tools</b>: C++, Java, Bash, Apache-mina(state message transfer), Jsch(port forwarding), Perl, LXC, InstaGENI, ExoGENI, PrimoGENI, VM instances.</li>

  <li><b>Car Parking Reservation</b> (2015) Object oriented design pattern and software development class project. A car parking reservation with search, book, incident reporting, payment submission features implemented in Java and MySQL. <b>Languages/Tools</b>: Java, MySQL, Eclipse-Papyrus. </li>
  <li><b> RED/XCP</b> (2011):          Extensibly studied TCP variants (vegas, reno etc.) for congestion control algorithms in NS-2 and recommended the best variant to use for a certain network architecture with unique bandwidth-delay scenarios. The models for NS-2 simulator was written in Tcl and the GB of results or the traces were parsed in Perl.</li>
