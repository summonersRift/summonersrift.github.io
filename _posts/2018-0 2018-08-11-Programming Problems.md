### Number and list manipulation
- How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to N? Canbe done in O(logn) time.
  - Can be done in O(n) if the numbers are not sorted. Hint: use n(n+1)/2
  - Can be done in O(log n) if the numbers are sorted.
- If a list contains some numbers exactly twice except for one number, find the number that occurs once. 
  - Use bitwise operation to solve in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
  - can uyse python set with add/remove, but would be O(n) time and space complexity.
