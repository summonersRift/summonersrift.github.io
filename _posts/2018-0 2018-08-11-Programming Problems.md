### Graph:
1. [Finding graph diameter](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)


### String:
1. [Sub-string Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTJr8OvyEVQ)


### Linked-list:
- [Sub-string Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTJr8OvyEVQ)
- How do you find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass?
  - Hint: Can be done with two pointers. [[Solution](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-find-middle-element-of-linked-list-one-pass.html)]
- Find if a linked list is palindrome withour using extra space.
  - Hint: Linked-list reverse.
- [Find sum of two numbes represented as Linked list and return the sum as a linked list.](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/description/)



### Number and list manipulation
- How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to N? Canbe done in O(logn) time.
  - Can be done in O(n) if the numbers are not sorted. Hint: use n(n+1)/2
  - Can be done in O(log n) if the numbers are sorted.
- If a list contains some numbers exactly twice except for one number, find the number that occurs once. 
  - Use bitwise operation to solve in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
  - can uyse python set with add/remove, but would be O(n) time and space complexity.
- Swapping two numbers without using a temporary memory or variable.
- Merge some intervals. Merging [[1-5], [4-6],[3-9], [8-14], [10-12], [16-19]] returns [[1-9], [8-14], [16-19]].
