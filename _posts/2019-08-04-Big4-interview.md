I get asked this all the time, how do one prepare for a Big4 (Amzon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft(alphabetically)) interview? Typically, people contacts me when they have an interview scheduled. So here is a brief guide to help you out in your journey.

Generally there are 3 interviews before landing an offer. (Excluding phone conversation with recruiter)
1. Online screen -- Optional at some companies (weed out above par condidates)
2. Phone interview -- (weed out above par condidates)
3. Onsite 2/3 coding and 1/2 system design rounds.

I will dive into the details and summarize key things to do from my experience interviewing at Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Samsung, etc. Fortunately, <b>big 4 </b> companies have similar interview structure. 




### Online screen and Phone Interview
What do I do? Do the folowing--

[LEETCODE TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/)" from the beginning. I mentioned it in ALL CAPS, because this is the single most important resource in my opinion.
- Solve Leetcode TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS(140 approx.), Do Easy, Medium, before starting to do Hard problems.
- Solve in order of frequency on the site.

### Onsite Interview
What do I do?
1. Still your best friend is -- [LEETCODE TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/). Revise it once. 
1. Undersand and **implement** Basic data structures. 101: (Implement all of them ground up, for example a BST, Heap, etc.) 101: String, LinkedLists, Tree, Trie, Graph, Sorting, Serching, Dynamic and Recursive programming etc.

1. System Design -- Grokking the system design interview on educative.


#### System Design 
- Time to learn system design.
  1. Design twitter, tinyurl, messenger,... [EDICATIVE.IO - Grokking the system design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512)
  1. [GoF Design Patterns](http://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/)
  1. Focus on building scalable, load balanced system
  1. Low latency applications
    1. Caching, CDN
  1. Failure tolerant systems
  1. Partitioning, Replication
  1. Integrate design pattern on small components
- Company wise Problem Solving
  1. Top leetcode problems in last 2 years
  1. Glassdoor reported problems ordered by date(latest/most recent)

#### My favorite books:
- Elements of Programming Interviews in Java/C++/Python by Adnan Aziz et.al. Get the book in the lanaugage you are most comfortable in.
- Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell Laakmann


#### Basics (I handpicked these from 100 or so topics)
- Anagrams and palindromes. Check whether a linked list is a palindrome
- String Search, KMP or Boyer Moore Search
- String reversal without affecting whitespace, special characters
- Basic singly linked list operations (Insert, Delete, Update, reverse, fix loops)
- Merge two sorted linked list without creating a new list
- Add two numbers represented by a linked list (in place)
- Solving problems with recursive Graph and LinkedList 
- BFS, DFS(in order and pre order traversals)
- Island perimeter with DFS
- Binary Search Tree node removal, insertion
- Calculate graph Diameter; lowest ancestor of two nodes
- Check whether a binary tree is full
- Index words in web pages(doc_name, line#) using a trie Tree
- You can take 1 or two steps at a time. How many ways to go to 50 steps? --(Coin)
- Implement min heap max heap from scratch with insertion and deletion
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick sort from scratch
- Find kth smallest or largest eleent in an unsorted array. (Sorting not allowed)
- Shortest path using DP
- Find all possible paths
- Parsing, check for invalid parentheses, braces.
- Reverse integer without extra memory
- Test if a number is prime.
- In a list one number occurs once everything else is twice. FInd the unique number
- Knapsacks
- Optimal Strategy in a game
- Bloomberg: Solve the stock buy sell profit problems.
- If you are aiming for google: String, DP(from geeksforgeeks), Recursion, Syntax matching, Search
- (A famous joke), if you are going for Microsoft, make sure u know how to reverse a linked list! We all know it takes much more than that.


#### Failed Onsite??
- Were they looking for a particular skill set/language proficiency?
  - You don't get hired, if you don't know it. 
  - GET OVER IT. 
- Keep applying, keep interviewing. DONT GIVE UP. 
  - The process itself is the biggest test.
- Made Mistakes?  
  - Try again.
