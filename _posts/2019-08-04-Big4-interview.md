I get asked this all the time, how do one prepare for a Big4 (Amzon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft(alphabetically)) interview? Typically, people contacts me when they have an interview scheduled. So here is a brief guide to help you out in your journey.

Generally there are 3 interviews before landing an offer. (Excluding phone conversation with recruiter)
1. Online screen -- Optional at some companies (weed out above par condidates)
2. Phone interview -- (weed out above par condidates)
3. Onsite 2/3 coding and 1/2 system design rounds.

I will dive into the details and summarize key things to do from my experience interviewing at Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Samsung, etc. Fortunately, <b>big 4 </b> companies have similar interview structure. 


## (1,2) Online screen and Phone Interview preparations:
What do I do? Do the folowing--

[LEETCODE TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/)" from the beginning. I mentioned it in ALL CAPS, because this is the single most important resource in my opinion.
- Solve Leetcode TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS(140 approx.), Do Easy, Medium, before starting to do Hard problems.
- Solve in order of frequency on the site.

## (3) Onsite Interview:
What do I do?
1. Still your best friend is -- [LEETCODE TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/). Revise it once. 
1. Undersand and **implement** Basic data structures. 101: (Implement all of them ground up, for example a BST, Heap, etc.) 101: String, LinkedLists, Tree, Trie, Graph, Sorting, Serching, Dynamic and Recursive programming etc.

## My favorite books:
- Elements of Programming Interviews in Java/C++/Python by Adnan Aziz et.al. Get the book in the lanaugage you are most comfortable in.
- Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell Laakmann


### Basics (I handpicked these from 100 or so topics)
- Anagrams and palindromes. Check whether a linked list is a palindrome
- String Search, KMP or Boyer Moore Search
- String reversal without affecting whitespace, special characters
- Basic singly linked list operations (Insert, Delete, Update, reverse, fix loops)
- Merge two sorted linked list without creating a new list
- Add two numbers represented by a linked list (in place)
- Solving problems with recursive Graph and LinkedList 
- BFS, DFS(in order and pre order traversals)
- Island perimeter with DFS
- Binary Search Tree node removal, insertion
- Calculate graph Diameter; lowest ancestor of two nodes
- Check whether a binary tree is full
- Index words in web pages(doc_name, line#) using a trie Tree
- You can take 1 or two steps at a time. How many ways to go to 50 steps? --(Coin)
- Implement min heap max heap from scratch with insertion and deletion
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick sort from scratch
- Find kth smallest or largest eleent in an unsorted array. (Sorting not allowed)
- Shortest path using DP
- Find all possible paths
- Parsing, check for invalid parentheses, braces.
- Reverse integer without extra memory
- Test if a number is prime.
- In a list one number occurs once everything else is twice. FInd the unique number
- Knapsacks
- Optimal Strategy in a game
- Bloomberg: Solve the stock buy sell profit problems.
- If you are aiming for google: String, DP(from geeksforgeeks), Recursion, Syntax matching, Search
- (A famous joke), if you are going for Microsoft, make sure u know how to reverse a linked list! We all know it takes much more than that.



## System Design 
- Time to learn system design.

  - GET OVER IT. 
- Keep applying, keep interviewing. DONT GIVE UP. 
  - The process itself is the biggest test.
- Made Mistakes?
