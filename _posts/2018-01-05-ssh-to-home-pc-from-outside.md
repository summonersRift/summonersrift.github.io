<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this post I will discuss how I setup ssh to home pc so that I can access it from anywhere else (office, cafe, blah, blah!!)</p>


### Overview

| Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Step1  | **Setup SSH on Desktop**: Install openssh-server and start it up, so that you can ssh to it locally from another computer in the same network|
| Step2  | **PUBLIC_IP**: From any computer in your home network, find out what is your public ip by goign to whatismyip.com |
| Step3 | **Port forwarding**: All traffic destined to port 22(default for ssh) should go to DESKTOP_IP:22 (an example figure given below)|
| Step4 | SSH from anywhere to PUBLIC_IP which will take you to DESKTOP_IP or your desktop|


#### Step 2: Getting Ip address from command line

<pre>

dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com | awk -F'"' '{ print $2}'

</pre>

#### Step 3: Port forwarding
Usually you can do it by going to 192.168.0.1 or the admin page of your router/modem.
