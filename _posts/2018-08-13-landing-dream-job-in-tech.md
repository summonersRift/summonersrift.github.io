I have interviewed at almost 10 of the top tech companies. The interview structure varies greatly by company. For example apple, samsung focuses a lot on the programming language internals. Big 4 companies have similar interview structure. The very **first thing to do** get started with your job hunt is to **start solving leetcode**, "[LEETCODE TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/)" from the beginning.

### Step-0: How Do I Get Started?
- By solving [Leetcode TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/): 145 total problems, start with **easy** problems and then solve the **medium** and finally try to solve some hard ones.
  - Solve Problems in random order, don't solve problems by topic. 
  - This helps your adaptivity.
  - Think brute force first.
  - (Think) Alternative ways to solve a problem.
  - Find the optimal solution and learn that solution.
  - If a problem bothers you too much (for hours), leave it for later. Move on.
- Clear your basic data structures 101: String, LinkedLists, Tree, Trie, Graph, Sorting, Serching, Dynamic and Recursive programming etc.
- Learn one language very well i.e. you dont require stackoverflow for solving basic problems.
- Make a cheatsheet and go through it once a week. Cheatsheet can be on a goodgle doc for the language/algorithm specifics you need to know in order to solve problems.
- Dont limit yourself to a book at the beginning. Follow the previous steps before getting into books. 
- Book1 (I love it): Elements of Programming Interviews in Java/C++/Python by Adnan Aziz et.al. Get the book in the lanaugage you are most comfortable in.
- Book2: Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell Laakmann


### Step 1: Resume
You are trying to build the right resume that will get you the interview calls. Best thing is to start with a template from Harvard/MIT/Gayle Laakmann Software engineer resume and go from there. 

1. Resume should be 1 page and 1 page only. 
1. Keep their design. Don’t customize design, waste of time.
1. Reorganize items to best represent your profile.
1. Use keywords related to a job/ category of jobs.
1. Use action words in describing projects or responsibilities.
1. List all of your projects, Class projects or Research projects (1 liner).
1. If you have never done projects it’s time to do some.
1. Get a friend/two (NOT EVERYBODY) to review your resume preferably someone in the industry.


### Step 2: Apply
Your goal is to get as many interview calls possible that are relevant to your background.
- If you don’t know know RubyOnRails, don’t write it on your resume. You should have some familiarity with every technology you write in your resume.
- Read the job description couple of times and see if they are looking for skills similar to you. Apply if you like it.
- Be flexible with location of the company.
- Apply at what u want to be, NOT who will call u.
- If the job doesn’t ask for expertise or specific skills, you can apply; but there will be stiff competition.
- Learn about ATS Applicant Tracking System and how to overcome it using word cloud or similar tools.
- You will start getting calls in a couple of months; however, you might have to wait couple of months.
- Make applying for jobs a habit. 20 applications/week. NOT 100 random applications/day.
- Dig into fortune top tech companies and apply from their site.
- Apply through LinkedIn EasyApply.
- Use IndeedPrime, stella.ai, leap.ai and similar tools. 

A brief list of top tech companies to work for in the US. Following is a laundry list of great tech companies in US.

- Big4: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsft
- Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn
- UBER / Lyft / Aurora / Tesla
- Netflix, Twitch, RIOT Games
- VM Ware, Cisco, Dell, HP
- Apple, Samsung, Samsung Research US
- Chipmakers: Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA
- Fintech: Bloomberg LP, Two-Sigma, Tableau
- Few Others
  - eBay, Paypal, Square, Walmart-Labs
  - Citrix- / Ultimate-software
  - Oracle, IBM, Salesforce-CRM, Digital-Ocean-cloud, SAP
- High growth Companies
  - Hubspot, Rackspace
  - Palantir, Spotify
  - Zillow, Airbnb
  - Box, Dropbox, Medium, Quora
- Settled-in the business
  - Adobe, Alibaba, Baidu, Deloitte, Epic, Fitbit, Yahoo, Yelp
_At the application stage, keep solving leetcode problems_

### Step -1: Application Rejections
- Rejections are mostly generated by an automated system
  - Generally a ATS system, less than a certain percentage of profile match.
  - Filter based rejection with keywords.
  - Some recruiters use workday software to filter resumes.
- This auto-rejection emails are worthless. Still keep applying at the same company, similar job. Someday a recruiter will eventually dig your application up.


### Step 3: Networking
LinkedIn helps a great deal in getting interviews.
- Update your entire profile. See how big guys write their profile. Describe every project. Lookup a HP/director.
- Make friends with recruiters. Occasionally send thank you to a selected few when they accept your request.
- Like, Comment relevant Recuiter/ Field Expert posts.
- Post/Share interesting things several times a week.
- Reach out to recruiters.
  - Introduce yourself
  - Write something personal, say i see what you are posting and love what you are doing
  - Find a job at their company, mention it
  - They get so many msgs they don’t wanna do the matchmaking.
  - Occasionally ask questions about their process 
  - They will help you out.

### Step 4: Phone Interview
- Structure of the Phone Interview
  - Few minutes about the job and the company
  - Solve a programming on hackerrank/ googledocs/ codepair
  - You can ask questions
- Take notes during interview
- Talk about your solution, the interviewer will ask questions, change the assumptions. 
- Talk about edge cases
- Know the time complexity
- Can't solve it? Think of a brute-force solution.
  - How can you eliminate /reduce total execution?

_Practice demo interview with peers on Pramp or similar sites.
Your programming practice, Leetcode, data structures will come handy now._


#### Step -1: Failed phone interview?
So, you failed a phone interview. Maybe you didn’t quite solve the problem or the solution is not optimal. So the interviewer decided you need more time, MORE PRACTICE. Next-
- Learn optimal solution to a problem.
  - There is no shame in learning, that guy also studied.
  - They didn’t invent KMP or Shortest path algorithm 
- Think of **alternative** ways to solve a problem
- Think, what if the constraints are altered.
- Learn to code in white-board, no-IDE environment
- Use pen-paper (not a pencil) to sketch.
  - No time to erase.

#### Step +1: Dealing with Failure
<pre>
                      it makes you stronger. ”
“If something doesn’t break you, 
</pre>

Always remember this.

Here is how it makes you stronger-
- In someway or the other.
- Every problem you are asked, learn optimal solution to it.
- Learn OPTIMAL solution to similar problems.
- Try NOT to make the same mistake again.

### Failed Onsite??
- Were they looking for a particular skill set/language proficiency?
  - You don't get hired, if you don't know it. 
  - GET OVER IT. 
- Keep applying, keep interviewing. DONT GIVE UP.
  - The process itself is the biggest test.
- Made Mistakes?
  - Go back a couple of slides, Dealing with failures.
